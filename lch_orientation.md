# LCH orientations project for Flore

The goal is to compute orientations of LCH disks. Specifically...
- we want to see the differentials of disks using the python interface.
- we want to update the documentation README.md file to tell users how the new functionality works.
- documentation in the code (triple quotation mark comments) should indicate how the new functionality works.
- we want to design a test to make sure that the results are as expected for some examples.
- all the tests should pass of course!
- this file will get deleted when the change is ready.
In `legendrian_links.py` and `test_main.py`, the important sections are marked with `TODO for lch_orientations...`

We want to do the minimal amount of work to implement the change. So...
- the webapp should not be updated yet.
- we won't yet want to think about computing augmentations for coefficient modulus other than 2, etc.
We can think about this later if we have time :D
